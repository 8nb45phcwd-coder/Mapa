# World Model (Scaffolding)

This package is a placeholder for future world-model metadata such as country tags, schemes, blocs, alliances, and supranational structures. No logic is implemented yet; it exists to provide a clean module boundary for future layers that will remain ID-driven and interoperable with the engine and ingestion modules.
